User Authentication:

Require a master password to access the password manager.
Implement strong authentication mechanisms to protect the master password.
Password Storage:

Allow users to store and manage multiple sets of login credentials.
Store each set of credentials securely, using encryption algorithms.
Include fields for username, password, and the associated website or application.
Password Generation:

Provide a tool to generate strong, random passwords.
Allow users to customize password length and include different character types.
Categories/Groups:

Allow users to organize and categorize their stored credentials (e.g., work, personal, finance).
Search and Sorting:

Implement a search functionality to quickly locate specific credentials.
Allow users to sort and filter their stored credentials based on different criteria.
Clipboard Management:

Include options to copy usernames and passwords to the clipboard for easy pasting.
Implement a feature that clears the clipboard after a set period to enhance security.
Auto-fill Integration:

Optionally integrate with web browsers to auto-fill login credentials on websites.
Backup and Restore:

Provide options for users to backup their password database.
Allow users to restore their password database from a backup.
Security Measures:

Implement a secure logout feature.
Include an inactivity timeout to automatically lock the application.
Consider using multi-factor authentication for an extra layer of security.
Password Strength Analysis:

Include a feature that analyzes the strength of passwords and provides recommendations for improvement.
Change Passwords:

Allow users to easily update or change their stored passwords.
Notifications:

Optionally include notifications for password expiration or security-related events.
Remember that security is a crucial aspect of a password manager, so prioritize implementing strong encryption practices and follow best security practices throughout the development process.



The __init__.py file is a special file in Python that indicates to the interpreter that the directory should be treated as a Python package. 
It can be an empty file, but its presence is required for Python to recognize the directory as a pack

Credential manager : Storing credentials of users
======================================================
To securely store sensitive information like passwords, it's crucial to use encryption. In the context of storing credentials in a database,
 we should consider hashing passwords and using symmetric encryption to protect other sensitive data. 
Here we would be  using the cryptography library in Python for password hashing and Fernet symmetric encryption
